Repository description:
This repository features all the code created 
by our "Banglaitalia" team, now publicly available 
and at everyone's disposal.

Folders description:

- Website: a website hosted on our raspberry, allowing
for 2D matrix pictures to be easily uploaded and printed.
Link to a reference website:
http://ironeurope.eu/bangla

- Arduino: Code to be uploaded on an Arduino Uno
connected to different engines and a Raspberry PI. 

- Raspberry PI: Processing code for pictures' pixels elaboration. 
Can either be run from a PC or from a Raspberry (way slower 
in this case because Java). It sends data over to the Arduino.
SSH script to be connected .

- Raspberry libraries requirements: Apache2, PHP5, PHP5 - SQL,
processing-2.0, PHP5 - SSH tunnel connection, java6, xvfb, 
a lot of patience.

- Rhino_Blueprints: 3D blueprints for cutting the wooden and
plexiglass pieces making up our printer box.
